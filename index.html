    <p>GS-NCR began its Greyhound Adoption initiative in 2009 in response to an increasing demand from interested individuals & families in the National Capital Region.  Having assisted with Greyhound placements in Ottawa homes on behalf of the adoption group in Montreal, it became apparent that the usually long wait for the eventual arrival of an adopted greyhound by interested families in Ottawa could be significantly shortened with the cooperation of and affiliation with a greyhound adoption kennel geographically closer to Ottawa than a kennel located in  the warmer Southern United States.</p>

<p>Consequently, with the establishment of an agreement and placement strategy with (NGA) Northern Greyhound Adoption, Vermont, USA,  similar to the one established by the Montreal adoption group - The League of Extraordinary Greyhounds (T-LEGS), GS-NCR has been able to identify, evaluate and place retired racing greyhounds in "forever homes" here in the National Capital Region.  The agreement with NGA includes a process of selection that fosters a close working relationship of GS-NCR representatives and NGA Kennel staff to actively work with the adoptive family in evaluating and selecting their retired racer.</p>

<p>The kennel is located in northern Vermont, is less than a four hour drive from Ottawa, through scenic Ontario or Quebec, as well as northern New Your and Vermont country sides.  Given its reasonably close proximity to Ottawa, it is accessible throughout the year subject to sympathetic weather conditions.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of adopting a greyhound and would like to work with the Greyhound Supporters in finding your new canine companion, please review the Adoption-related links on the left-hand side of this page and don't hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>
